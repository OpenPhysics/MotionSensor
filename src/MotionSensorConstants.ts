 * Conventions
 * ───────────
 *  - Physics / model values use SI units (metres, seconds, kilograms, …);
 *    note the unit in a comment on each value.
 *  - Layout / chrome values are in screen pixels.
 *  - Colour strings live in MotionSensorColors.ts, not here.
 *  - Computed expressions (e.g. `2 * Math.PI`) may stay inline.
