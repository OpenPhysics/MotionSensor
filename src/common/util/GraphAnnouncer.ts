 * Voicing for the configurable graph. Changing an axis replaces the plot
 * wholesale — the label, the scale and every point — which a sighted user takes
 * in at a glance and a screen-reader user otherwise learns only by hunting. One
 * spoken sentence per change closes that gap.
 *
 * Voicing is used rather than a manual ARIA live region so the announcement
 * honours the user's own voicing preferences, following PhET's practice.
 *
 * The utterance is reused and given a stable delay so that flicking through the
 * combo box announces where you landed, not every option you passed on the way.
