/**
 * PositionSource.ts
 *
 * The seam that lets the Simulation screen and the Motion Sensor screen run the
 * same model, the same chart, and the same scorer. A source answers one
 * question — where is the walker right now, in metres from the sensor — and the
 * model samples that answer on its own fixed clock.
 *
 * ── Why "latest value", not a running total ───────────────────────────────────
 * RadioactivityAndStatistics solves the same problem with a monotonically
 * increasing count, so that a mismatch between the sim's clock and the device's
 * clock cannot lose events. That trick is specific to *counting*: totals can be
 * differenced over any interval. Position is a continuous signal that is sampled,
 * not accumulated, so the contract here is deliberately different — the source
 * publishes its most recent reading and the model decides when to look.
