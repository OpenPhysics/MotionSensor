/**
 * SensorPositionSource.ts
 *
 * The Motion Sensor screen's source: a PASCO Wireless Motion Sensor (PS-3219)
 * reached directly through Web Bluetooth using its small PASCO wire protocol.
 *
 * ── Polling, not streaming ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One `readEchoTime` is one BLE round trip. Polling begins only when a run is
 * started and stops when that run ends, silencing the ultrasonic transducer
 * between attempts while leaving the Bluetooth connection ready.
 *
 * ── What the device measures, and what this publishes ─────────────────────────
 * The device answers with an echo time, and nothing else. Everything a student
 * can change about the reading is applied here, on the host, in one place and in
 * one order:
 *
 *   echo time ─▶ distance ─▶ range gate ─▶ − zero offset ─▶ × sign ─▶ published
 *
 * That is the same set of adjustments PASCO's own software offers (Change Sign,
 * Zero Sensor Now, Zero at Start, Range), and it is applied in the same order:
 * an offset captured with the sign flipped still zeroes where the student stood.
 * Diagnostics deliberately report the *raw* distance, before any of it — that is
 * the number that tells you whether the hardware is answering.
 *
 * ── Errors never reach the caller ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `connect()` resolves even when it fails. Connection outcomes are UI state, not
 * exceptions: the button listener stays synchronous (so the browser still sees a
 * user gesture), and every outcome lands on `connectionStateProperty` /
 * `errorMessageProperty` where the panel can render it. A cancelled device
 * picker is not a failure — it returns to DISCONNECTED with no message.
