/**
 * MotionSensorModel.ts
 *
 * Everything both screens share: where the recording is in its lifecycle, the
 * recorded trace, and the live position / velocity / acceleration the graph
 * samples from.
 *
 * The two screens differ in exactly one way — where position comes from — so the
 * source is chosen once, at construction, and nothing below branches on it.
 *
 * ── One clock, two screens ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The trace is sampled on a fixed-timestep accumulator rather than on raw frame
 * dt. A recording therefore has the same number of samples, at the same
 * instants, whether it came from a 144 Hz display dragging a walker or from a
 * sensor answering every 40 ms. The rate of that clock is chosen by the student
 * ({@link sampleRateProperty}) and captured when a recording starts. Two runs at
 * the same rate are comparable across screens and machines, and the graph's time
 * axis is evenly spaced instead of bunching wherever the browser happened to be
 * busy.
 *
 * {@link sampleEmitter} fires on that clock, which is what the view feeds the
 * graph from — not the frame loop.
