/**
 * Trace.ts
 *
 * The recorded run: position sampled on the model's fixed clock, plus the
 * velocity and acceleration derived from it. The clock's rate is the student's
 * choice, so the windows below are counted from a fixed *duration* rather than
 * from a fixed number of samples — 0.2 s of smoothing at 5 Hz and at 50 Hz.
 *
 * Velocity is always differentiated here, host-side, even on the Motion Sensor
 * screen where the device could report its own. Two reasons: the sensor's
 * derivative uses a different window from ours, so the two screens would not
 * agree on the same motion; and reading one measurement per BLE round trip
 * instead of three keeps the poll rate up.
 *
 * Every derivative is *trailing*, never centred. A centred window would let a
 * sample recorded later change the shape of the curve already drawn, so the plot
 * would rewrite its own past as you watched it. The cost is a half-window of lag
 * — the honest price of a causal filter.
